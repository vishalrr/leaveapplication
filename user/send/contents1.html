Passwords are very important to user accounts, but there may come a time when you need to change 
your password or maybe you forgot your password.
If a user forgets their password, they can type 
in their email address and click the login button 
 'forgot my passwordâ€™ and the password will be sent to the email address.
<h1>FORGOT PASSWORD.</h1>
